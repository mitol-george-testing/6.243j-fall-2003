description: 'Lecture 2: Ordinary differential equations (ODE) are the most frequently
  used tool for modeling continuous-time nonlinear dynamical systems.This section
  presents results on existence of solutions for ODE models,which,in a systems context,translate
  into ways of proving well-posedness of interconnections.'
